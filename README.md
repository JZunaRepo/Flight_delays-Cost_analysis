# Flight_delays-Cost_analysis

<h2>Project Overview</h2>
<p>The purpose of this project is to connect to a local database hosted in psycopg2 and analyze the ratio of delays by each airport in the US and individual airlines across the country.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Steps for this project</h2>
<p>1. Using the information hosted in our local database, we connected to the database and classify delayed airlines to identify the rows of interest</p>
<p>2. Then, I created groups in order to find the ratio per airline of delayed flights.</p>
<p>3. Using the same rationality, we can also find the ratio per airport of delayed flights.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>You can find the code for this project on the file [get_delays.py](https://github.com/JZunaRepo/Flight_delays-Cost_analysis/blob/main/get_delays.py) </p>
